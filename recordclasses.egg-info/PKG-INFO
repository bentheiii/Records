        # Records
        Records is a python library that makes powerful structure classes easy.
        
        [API reference](https://records.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
        
        ## Simplest Example
        A feature of Records is that, by default, it does nothing more than a namedtuple or dataclass would.
        ```python
        from records import RecordBase
        
        class Point(RecordBase):
            x: float
            y: float
            z: float = 0.0
        
        p0 = Point(x=0, y=0)
        print(p0)  # Point(x=0, y=0)
        print(p0.x)  # 0
        # note that no type checking or coercion is performed
        print(type(p0.y))  # int
        # by default, the type hints are not even run
        p1 = Point(x="hello", y="world", z="1.0")
        print(p1.y)  # world
        print(type(p1.z))  # str
        ```
        
        ## Checking, Coercion, and Validation
        Sometimes we'd like to perform some additional processing to arguments before they are entered into the struct. For that we have three steps: type-checking, coercion, and validation
        * type-checking is the first and simplest step, it simply checks that the argument is of the type we expect. If it isn't, then we perform coercion.
        * type coercion only occurs if typechecking has failed, it will attempt to convert the into the type we expect. As one may expect, there is a large number of potential coercers, so they must be added each individually.
        * validation occurs after either type checking or type coercion have succeeded. By this point we are certain that the input is of the correct type and we want to ensure/manipulate its value.
        
        These methods are described per-field with the `Annotation` type hint (`Annotation` is new in python 3.9, but has been backported by `records` for older versions to use)
        
        These three steps are expanded upon in the documentation, for now we will show some brief examples:
        ```python
        from typing import List
        from records import RecordBase, Annotated, check, check_strict, Loose, Within, Eval
        
        class Person(RecordBase):
            first_name: str  # no coercion or checking here, this is what we call a "hollow" field
            last_name: Annotated[str, check]  # now we will raise a TypeError if anyone tries to enter a non-string last_name  
            year_of_birth: Annotated[int, check_strict]  # we will raise a TypeError if year_of_birth isn't exactly an int (so passing True will throw an error)
            lucky_number: Annotated[int, check, Loose]  # the "Loose" built-in coerser will simply call the destination type with the input as an argument, so that using `lucky_number="7"` would be equivalent to `lucky_number=int("7")`
            number_of_children: Annotated[int, check, Within(ge=0)]  # the Within built-in validator ensures the value is within stated bounds (in this case, at least zero)
            # field tokens can even be more complex in case of nested field types
            names_of_children: Annotated[List[Annotated[int, check, Eval]], check]  # the list will be checked to be a list, and each item individually will be checked or coerced to be an int using the built-in Eval coercer.
            
            # validators can also be added after declaration with pre_bind
            @classmethod
            def pre_bind(cls):
                @cls.last_name.add_validator
                def no_bad_words(last_name):
                    # we want to remove some words from the last name
                    return last_name.replace('richard', '*******')
        
            # we can also add some more pre-processing on an entire instance with "post_new"
            def post_new(self):
                if len(self.names_of_children) != self.number_of_children:
                    raise ValueError("children mismatch")
        ```
        ## Parsing
        Records can also be parsed from various python primitives. Including parsing from `dict`s, jsons, and even generic namepaces.
        ```python
        from types import SimpleNamespace
        from records import RecordBase, check
        
        class User(RecordBase, default_type_check=check):
            name: str
            password: str
            age: int = 18
            
        
        print(User.from_mapping({"name": "richard", "password": "swordfish"}))
        print(User.from_json('{"name": "richard", "password": "swordfish"})'))
        n = SimpleNamespace(user="rich", password="ard", age= 7)
        print(User.from_instance(n))
        
        # parsing can even be done if you expect misnamed fields!
        from_upper_dict = User.from_mapping.select(keys_to_rename=[('user','name')], keys_to_remove=['favorite_color'])
        print(from_upper_dict({'user':'richard', 'password': 'pw', 'favorite_color': 'red'}))
        ```
        
        You can also define your own parsers and even use them in construction!
        ```python
        from math import sqrt
        from records import RecordBase, check, SelectableFactory, parser
        
        class Point(RecordBase, default_type_check=check):
            x: float
            y: float
            z: float = 0
            
            @parser
            @SelectableConstructor
            @classmethod
            def from_tuple(cls, v):
                return {'x':v[0], 'y':v[1], 'z':v[2] if len(v) > 2 else 0}
        
            @property
            def norm(self):
                return sqrt(self.x**2 + self.y**2 + self.z**2)
        
        p = Point([2,3,6])
        print(p.norm)  # 7
        ```
        ## Exporting
        Records can also be exporting to various formats (same as parsing).
        ```python
        from records import RecordBase, check
        
        class Point(RecordBase, default_type_check=check):
            x: float
            y: float
            z: float
        
        p = Point(x=2, y=3, z=6)
        print(p.to_dict())
        print(p.to_pickle())
        #  again, we can select to change the keys
        print(
            p.to_json.select(keys_to_add=[('w',0)])()
        )
        ```
